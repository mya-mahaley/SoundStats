###Deviations:
- Sonya was dealing with a family emergency, and will be making up for the contribution difference in the next phase
- Evelyn had two job interviews during this phase
- Due to time constraints, and several errors, the Login with Facebook button could not be implemented. We will try again in the following phase, but we are considering removing the feature because it doesn't provide any additional functionality to the app
- The Apple Music API costs $100, so we cannot use it for this project, and will be focusing on Spotify Users
