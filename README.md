### Deviations:
- Sonya was dealing with a family emergency, and will be making up for the contribution difference in the next phase
- Evelyn had two job interviews during this phase
- Due to time constraints, and several errors, the Login with Facebook button could not be implemented. We will try again in the following phase, but we are considering removing the feature because it doesn't provide any additional functionality to the app
- The Apple Music API costs $100, so we cannot use it for this project, and will be focusing on Spotify Users

### Additional Note:
How to run SoundStats on your phone:
- Put your phone in developer mode
- Plug your phone into your Mac
- In XCode, choose your iPhone as your simulation device
    - Run the code
    - The app should appear on your phone. If you cannot open it, try the following;
        -  Change the bundle identifier of the app to something unique
        -  For “team”, use your personal account
        -  On your iPhone, go to Settings > General > VPN & Device Management, then trust the developer that appears there
        -  Re-run the code, you should be able to open SoundStats now
        -  When you press the “Connect to Spotify” button, you will be asked to authorize SoundStats to access your Spotify data 
        -   Once you grant access, your Spotify may begin playing music
